# Python-Game "Skywalker\'s War"
The game is based on a video game in the genre of fixed shooter Galaga. This is the first beta version of my game, written using the Pygame library.

In the future, it is planned to add: sounds and music, several spaceships to choose from, difficulty levels, boss, bonuses and much more.
